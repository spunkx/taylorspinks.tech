	//interactable grid = find centre of grid
    //tag the centre
    //measure 1/2 some division of one line to the next line in both x and y direction
    //define tag as the area of that singular square
    //do this total squares minus 1/n, and then mirror on the left over
    //merge with current implementation for efficiency
    //must convert from grid cords to screen cords (css pixel values)



fancy colours for grid
    //event is the event object
    //xy is the multiplication of x and y
    //if I move in the x direction with the mouse I add to the "r" in the rbg
    //if I move in the y directoin with the mouse I add to the "b" in the rbg
    //if I move in the diagonal direction with the mouse I add to the "g"
    //mouse direction determine by getting the pixel location of the squares and comparing it to the pixel location of the mouse
